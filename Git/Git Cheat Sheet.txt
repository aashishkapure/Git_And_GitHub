Certainly! Here's a cheat sheet with some of the most commonly used Git and GitHub commands along with examples:

### Git Basics

1. **Initialize a Repository**
   - `git init`: Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory.

2. **Clone a Repository**
   - `git clone <repository_url>`: Copies a remote repository to your local machine.
   - Example: `git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git`

3. **Add Changes**
   - `git add <file>`: Stages changes for the next commit.
   - Example: `git add filename.txt`

4. **Commit Changes**
   - `git commit -m "commit message"`: Records staged changes with a commit message.
   - Example: `git commit -m "Add new feature"`

5. **View Commit History**
   - `git log`: Displays a history of commits in the current branch.

6. **Branches**
   - `git branch`: Lists all branches in the repository.
   - `git branch <branch_name>`: Creates a new branch.
   - `git checkout <branch_name>`: Switches to an existing branch.
   - `git merge <branch_name>`: Merges changes from one branch into the current branch.

7. **Remote Operations**
   - `git remote -v`: Lists remote repositories.
   - `git push <remote> <branch>`: Pushes local changes to a remote repository.
   - `git pull <remote> <branch>`: Fetches changes from a remote repository and merges them into the current branch.

8. **Undoing Changes**
   - `git reset <file>`: Unstages changes.
   - `git checkout -- <file>`: Discards changes in a file.
   - `git revert <commit>`: Creates a new commit that undoes the changes introduced by a previous commit.

### GitHub-Specific Commands

9. **GitHub Workflow**
   - `git remote add origin <repository_url>`: Links a local repository to a GitHub repository.
   - `git push -u origin <branch_name>`: Pushes the branch to GitHub and sets it as the upstream branch.

10. **Pull Requests**
    - `git pull-request`: Opens a pull request on GitHub for the current branch.
    - `hub pull-request -f "<description>"`: Opens a pull request with a description.

11. **Issues**
    - `hub issue create -t "<title>" -m "<body>"`: Creates a new issue on GitHub.

12. **Collaboration**
    - `git fork`: Creates a fork of a repository on GitHub.
    - `git remote add upstream <original_repo_url>`: Adds the original repository as an upstream remote.
    - `git fetch upstream`: Fetches changes from the original repository.

This cheat sheet covers some of the most frequently used Git and GitHub commands. Remember to replace placeholders like `<repository_url>`, `<branch_name>`, `<commit>`, `<file>`, `<title>`, and `<body>` with your specific information.
